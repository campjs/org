# campJS organisation things

This is a repository that attempts to do the following:

- Collect notes from meetings we've had (with anyone that is interested).  Generally these occur at a CampJS event as we are conveniently in one place, however, it's likely there will be slack conversations and online video chats that may also warrant similar documentation.

- Collect issues and pull requests from the community with a view to continue to ensure that CampJS is the best educational coding retreat that it can possibly be.

## PR process (pending creation of an official contributing readme)

- With regards to meeting notes, please raise PRs against the notes from a meeting as earlier as you can.  Meeting notes will be announced on [WeAllJS #campjs slack channel](https://wealljs.slack.com/messages/G64JQPQUC/).  After that we'll keep accepting PRs on a meeting notes file for ~ 2 weeks (as a general guideline).

## Questions

- If you have any questions at this stage, please feel free to hit up myself (`damon@campjs.com`) as until we've worked out a solid path forward I'm happy to help coordinate things.

## Keep an eye on the issues

Please keep an eye on the issues in this repository (we'll look into a way to make them obvious somewhere) as they are things that I think are of interest to a lot of folks.
